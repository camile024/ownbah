#Libraries
Put all the libraries used in here (with version and download link if possible) so others can compile the code.  
If possible - try to upload precompiled libraries to folders according to your system and the executable (e.g. client/libraries/precompiled(MSVS)  
Libraries should also be listed on top of the main.cpp file of both executables.

-OpenGL (glew 2.0.0) - all the drawing
