#Data structure
I'm currently working out how to manage territory data and map  

1) Each territory will be an object with things like:  
-upgrades  
-vertices  
-sea - which sea/ocean the territory belongs to (can attack only through sea/ocean you both belong too)  
2) We need to store vertices with seas too
